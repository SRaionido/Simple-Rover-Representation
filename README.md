# Simple-Rover-Representation
This is the final project I and two other classmates created for the University of California, Riverside class CS179J. This project uses the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 FPGA to create a conceptual representation of controlling a rover. This project also uses a small HDMI monitor to display the direction the rover would be moving and buttons on the PYNQ-Z2 are used to control the system.

In this project I implemented the code for the finite state machine and button interaction for the FPGA, as well as took one of my teammates set of code outputting to HDMI and integrating it into the finite state machine.
